  # Exclude all third-party libraries in wwwroot/lib (most important!)
  - 'AS_Practical_Assignment/wwwroot/lib/**'
  - '**/wwwroot/lib/**'
  - 'wwwroot/lib/**'
  
  # Exclude specific problematic files by name
  - '**/jquery*.js'

  # Exclude all minified files
  - '**/*.min.js'
  - '**/*.min.css'
  
  # Exclude other common third-party paths
  - '**/node_modules/**'
  - '**/dist/**'
  - '**/vendor/**'
  - '**/bin/**'
  - '**/obj/**'

# Do NOT use 'paths' - let it scan everything except what's in paths-ignore
# The 'paths' directive overrides 'paths-ignore', causing libraries to be scanned
